# A Spiking Neural-Focused Model of Primary Progressive Aphasia

Project for BME 499 Elective Research Project (Winter 2024), University of Waterloo. 

_Abstract:_ Primary progressive aphasia is a disorder affecting speech production, comprehension, repetition, and a variety of other language abilities. Since typical brain damage affects multiple regions, it is difficult to study the contribution of a particular language region. As such, computational aphasia modelling can be used to examine the mechanisms behind language in a controlled manner. However,
many traditional models lack biological detail, creating a need for a neural-focused aphasia model. Therefore, this project covers an implementation of primary progressive aphasia modelling using spiking neuron representations. Results of the experimentation show that a spiking model can replicate naming, comprehension, and repetition task performance with similar accuracies and high correlation while providing a biologically plausible account of neuron activation. Future work includes extending the spiking aphasia model to use distributed representations for scalability, and measuring model performance in the presence of noise.
